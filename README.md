🎬 Data-Backed Film Production Strategy — IMDb Analytics Project (2025–2026)

This project uses large-scale IMDb metadata to design a data-driven creative strategy for a new film production venture. The analysis translates historical film performance patterns into actionable recommendations on genre focus, runtime targets, and talent selection.

The goal: support film production decisions using evidence instead of intuition.

📌 Business Problem

New production studios often lack historical performance benchmarks. This project analyzes IMDb movie data to identify what combinations of genre, runtime, and creative talent are most strongly associated with higher ratings and audience popularity.
