Objective

To identify data-supported creative strategy directions for a new film production venture using historical IMDb performance data.

Approach
1. Defined business question: what should a new studio produce first?
2. Selected IMDb non-commercial movie dataset
3. Filtered to movies only (2005–2025)
4. Removed:
   - Adult titles
   - Missing ratings
   - Duplicate records
5. Built analytical dataset with genre, runtime, ratings, votes, talent
6. Performed:
   - Trend analysis
   - Distribution analysis
   - Genre performance comparison
   - Talent clustering
7. Converted insights into strategic production recommendations

Limitations
- Ratings ≠ revenue success
- Popularity influenced by marketing budgets
- IMDb audience bias possible
- Not a causal model — pattern-based analysis
